							<h2> 1. Heat Stress</h2>
							<p>Competitors often use Core Temperature as the determining factor in assessing dehydration- however, we know that Core Temp is a lagging indicator of dehydration, and there are far better ways to determine heat stress. 
							Taking key metrics from fitness trackers such as VO2 /VO2 Max Ratio, HR and HRV, our algorithms produce a comprehensive dehydration risk that is predictive rather than reactive, and offers targeted interventions based on a worker’s personal fitness and environmental factors.  
							This will prevent your employees from injuring themselves or their coworkers through overexertion and dehydration.</p>
