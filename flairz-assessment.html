							<h2>Heat Stress </h2>
							<p>Competitors often use Core Temperature as the determining factor in assessing dehydration- however, we know that Core Temp is a lagging indicator of dehydration, and there are far more proactive ways to determine heat stress. 
							Taking key metrics from fitness trackers such as VO2 /VO2 Max Ratio, HR and HRV, our algorithms produce a comprehensive dehydration risk that is predictive rather than reactive, and offers targeted interventions based on a workerâ€™s personal fitness and environmental factors.  
							This will prevent your employees from injuring themselves or their coworkers through overexertion and dehydration. </p>

							<h2>Fatigue</h2>
							<p>When workers reach a level of cardiovascular exertion, increased effort is needed to perform work tasks correctly and avoid errors or injury. 
							Particularly in industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, construction and mining, workplace errors tend to be more catastrophic, and fatigue management is particularly important to ensure the safety of workers and to prevent injury.  
							FLAIRZ uses the constant feed of biometric information from trackers to objectively determine fatigue levels of your workers in real time.  We then inform them of a comprehensive rest plan and warn them about potential hazards for the next shift. 
							By conducting an assessment and implementing these measures, companies can create a more energized and productive work environment, leading to improved employee satisfaction and performance.</p>
